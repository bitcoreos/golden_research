### Enhancing Model Privacy in Federated Learning with Random Masking and Quantization
**Date:** 2025-08-27 | **Arxiv:** [2508.18911](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18911)

#### Abstract
The primary goal of traditional federated learning is to protect data privacy by enabling distributed edge devices to collaboratively train a shared global model while keeping raw data decentralized at local clients. The rise of large language models (LLMs) has introduced new challenges in distributed systems, as their substantial computational requirements and the need for specialized expertise raise critical concerns about protecting intellectual property (IP). This highlights the need for a federated learning approach that can safeguard both sensitive data and proprietary models. To tackle this challenge, we propose FedQSN, a federated learning approach that leverages random masking to obscure a subnetwork of model parameters and applies quantization to the remaining parameters. Consequently, the server transmits only a privacy-preserving proxy of the global model to clients during each communication round, thus enhancing the model's confidentiality. Experimental results across various models and tasks demonstrate that our approach not only maintains strong model performance in federated learning settings but also achieves enhanced protection of model parameters compared to baseline methods.

### Efficient Pain Recognition via Respiration Signals: A Single Cross-Attention Transformer Multi-Window Fusion Pipeline
**Date:** 2025-08-26 | **Arxiv:** [2507.21886](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21886)

#### Abstract
Pain is a complex condition that affects a large portion of the population. Accurate and consistent evaluation is essential for individuals experiencing pain and supports the development of effective and advanced management strategies. Automatic pain assessment systems provide continuous monitoring, aid clinical decision-making, and aim to reduce distress while preventing functional decline. This study has been submitted to the Second Multimodal Sensing Grand Challenge for Next-Gen Pain Assessment (AI4PAIN). The proposed method introduces a pipeline that employs respiration as the input signal and integrates a highly efficient cross-attention transformer with a multi-windowing strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that respiration serves as a valuable physiological modality for pain assessment. Furthermore, results show that compact and efficient models, when properly optimized, can deliver strong performance, often surpassing larger counterparts. The proposed multi-window strategy effectively captures short-term and long-term features, along with global characteristics, enhancing the model's representational capacity.

### Efficient and Effective Query Context-Aware Learning-to-Rank Model for Sequential Recommendation
**Date:** 2025-08-13 | **Arxiv:** [2507.03789](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03789)

#### Abstract
Modern sequential recommender systems commonly use transformer-based models for next-item prediction. While these models demonstrate a strong balance between efficiency and quality, integrating interleaving features - such as the query context (e.g., browse category) under which next-item interactions occur - poses challenges. Effectively capturing query context is crucial for refining ranking relevance and enhancing user engagement, as it provides valuable signals about user intent within a session. Unlike item features, historical query context is typically not aligned with item sequences and may be unavailable at inference due to privacy constraints or feature store limitations - making its integration into transformers both challenging and error-prone. This paper analyzes different strategies for incorporating query context into transformers trained with a causal language modeling procedure as a case study. We propose a new method that effectively fuses the item sequence with query context within the attention mechanism. Through extensive offline and online experiments on a large-scale online platform and open datasets, we present evidence that our proposed method is an effective approach for integrating query context to improve model ranking quality in terms of relevance and diversity.
