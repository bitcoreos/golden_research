### Scaling Physical Reasoning with the PHYSICS Dataset
**Date:** 2025-10-20 | **Arxiv:** [2506.00022](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/scaling-physical-reasoning-with-the-physics-dataset/17916)

#### Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on advanced reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding competitions. Meanwhile, physics, despite being both reasoning-intensive and essential to real-world understanding, received limited academic and industrial attention. This paper introduces PHYSICS, a dataset containing 16,568 high-quality physics problems spanning subjects and difficulty levels, to facilitate this issue. Specifically, PHYSICS is curated with exercises from over 100 textbooks through a carefully designed pipeline for quality control. It covers five major physics domains: Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Thermodynamics, Optics, and Modern Physics. It also spans a wide range of difficulty levels, from high school to graduate-level physics courses. To utilize the data for improving and evaluating the model's physical reasoning capabilities, we split the dataset into training and test sets, and provide reasoning paths generated by powerful reasoning models for the training data to facilitate model training. In addition, for the evaluation part, we find that existing evaluation frameworks exhibit biases in aspects such as units, simplification, and precision in physics domain. To balance efficiency and accuracy, we introduce a Rule+Model evaluation framework tailored to physics problems. Our evaluations on current state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models highlight the limitations of current models in handling physics-related tasks. We hope that our dataset and evaluation methodology will jointly advance the development of LLMs in the field of physics. The code and data can be found at: https://github.com/Zhengsh123/PHYSICS.

### OpenEstimate: Evaluating LLMs on Reasoning Under Uncertainty with Real-World Data
**Date:** 2025-10-20 | **Arxiv:** [2510.15096](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/openestimate-evaluating-llms-on-reasoning-under-uncertainty-with-real-world-data/17830)

#### Abstract
Real-world settings where language models (LMs) are deployed -- in domains spanning healthcare, finance, and other forms of knowledge work -- require models to grapple with incomplete information and reason under uncertainty. Yet most LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success criteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving uncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of the same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which LMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer reliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains poorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an extensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation tasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background information and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these priors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to samples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we find that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident. Performance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the model, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning effort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging evaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are better at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty.

### A Theoretical Study on Bridging Internal Probability and Self-Consistency for LLM Reasoning
**Date:** 2025-10-20 | **Arxiv:** [2510.15444](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/a-theoretical-study-on-bridging-internal-probability-and-self-consistency-for-llm-reasoning/17791)

#### Abstract
Test-time scaling seeks to improve the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs) by adding computational resources. A prevalent approach within the field is sampling-based test-time scaling methods, which enhance reasoning by generating multiple reasoning paths for a given input during inference. However, despite its practical success, the theoretical foundations remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical framework for analyzing sampling-based test-time scaling methods, grounded in the perspective of confidence estimation. Based on the framework, we analyze two dominant paradigms: self-consistency and perplexity, and reveal key limitations: self-consistency suffers from high estimation error while perplexity exhibits substantial modeling error and possible degradation of the estimation error convergence. To address these limitations, we introduce RPC, a hybrid method that leverages our theoretical insights through two key components: Perplexity Consistency and Reasoning Pruning. Perplexity Consistency combines the strengths of self-consistency and perplexity, boosting the convergence rate of estimation error from linear to exponential while preserving model error. Reasoning Pruning prevents degradation by eliminating low-probability reasoning paths. Both theoretical analysis and empirical results across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that RPC has a strong potential for reducing reasoning error. Notably, RPC achieves reasoning performance comparable to self-consistency while not only enhancing confidence reliability but also reducing sampling costs by 50%. The code and resources are available at https://wnjxyk.github.io/RPC.

### Absolute Zero: Reinforced Self-play Reasoning with Zero Data
**Date:** 2025-10-17 | **Arxiv:** [2505.03335](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/absolute-zero-reinforced-self-play-reasoning-with-zero-data/17615)

#### Abstract
Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown promise in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models by learning directly from outcome-based rewards. Recent RLVR works that operate under the zero setting avoid supervision in labeling the reasoning process, but still depend on manually curated collections of questions and answers for training. The scarcity of high-quality, human-produced examples raises concerns about the long-term scalability of relying on human supervision, a challenge already evident in the domain of language model pretraining. Furthermore, in a hypothetical future where AI surpasses human intelligence, tasks provided by humans may offer limited learning potential for a superintelligent system. To address these concerns, we propose a new RLVR paradigm called Absolute Zero, in which a single model learns to propose tasks that maximize its own learning progress and improves reasoning by solving them, without relying on any external data. Under this paradigm, we introduce the Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR), a system that self-evolves its training curriculum and reasoning ability by using a code executor to both validate proposed code reasoning tasks and verify answers, serving as an unified source of verifiable reward to guide open-ended yet grounded learning. Despite being trained entirely without external data, AZR achieves overall SOTA performance on coding and mathematical reasoning tasks, outperforming existing zero-setting models that rely on tens of thousands of in-domain human-curated examples. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AZR can be effectively applied across different model scales and is compatible with various model classes.

### Exploratory Causal Inference in SAEnce
**Date:** 2025-10-17 | **Arxiv:** [2510.14073](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/exploratory-causal-inference-in-saence/17424)

#### Abstract
Randomized Controlled Trials are one of the pillars of science; nevertheless, they rely on hand-crafted hypotheses and expensive analysis. Such constraints prevent causal effect estimation at scale, potentially anchoring on popular yet incomplete hypotheses. We propose to discover the unknown effects of a treatment directly from data. For this, we turn unstructured data from a trial into meaningful representations via pretrained foundation models and interpret them via a sparse autoencoder. However, discovering significant causal effects at the neural level is not trivial due to multiple-testing issues and effects entanglement. To address these challenges, we introduce Neural Effect Search, a novel recursive procedure solving both issues by progressive stratification. After assessing the robustness of our algorithm on semi-synthetic experiments, we showcase, in the context of experimental ecology, the first successful unsupervised causal effect identification on a real-world scientific trial.

### Using LLMs to Directly Guess Conditional Expectations Can Improve Efficiency in Causal Estimation
**Date:** 2025-10-15 | **Arxiv:** [2510.09684](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/using-llms-to-directly-guess-conditional-expectations-can-improve-efficiency-in-causal-estimation/16646)

#### Abstract
We propose a simple yet effective use of LLM-powered AI tools to improve causal estimation. In double machine learning, the accuracy of causal estimates of the effect of a treatment on an outcome in the presence of a high-dimensional confounder depends on the performance of estimators of conditional expectation functions. We show that predictions made by generative models trained on historical data can be used to improve the performance of these estimators relative to approaches that solely rely on adjusting for embeddings extracted from these models. We argue that the historical knowledge and reasoning capacities associated with these generative models can help overcome curse-of-dimensionality problems in causal inference problems. We consider a case study using a small dataset of online jewelry auctions, and demonstrate that inclusion of LLM-generated guesses as predictors can improve efficiency in estimation.

### The Robustness of Differentiable Causal Discovery in Misspecified Scenarios
**Date:** 2025-10-15 | **Arxiv:** [2510.12503](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/the-robustness-of-differentiable-causal-discovery-in-misspecified-scenarios/16677)

#### Abstract
Causal discovery aims to learn causal relationships between variables from targeted data, making it a fundamental task in machine learning. However, causal discovery algorithms often rely on unverifiable causal assumptions, which are usually difficult to satisfy in real-world data, thereby limiting the broad application of causal discovery in practical scenarios. Inspired by these considerations, this work extensively benchmarks the empirical performance of various mainstream causal discovery algorithms, which assume i.i.d. data, under eight model assumption violations. Our experimental results show that differentiable causal discovery methods exhibit robustness under the metrics of Structural Hamming Distance and Structural Intervention Distance of the inferred graphs in commonly used challenging scenarios, except for scale variation. We also provide the theoretical explanations for the performance of differentiable causal discovery methods. Finally, our work aims to comprehensively benchmark the performance of recent differentiable causal discovery methods under model assumption violations, and provide the standard for reasonable evaluation of causal discovery, as well as to further promote its application in real-world scenarios.

### Robust Causal Discovery in Real-World Time Series with Power-Laws
**Date:** 2025-10-14 | **Arxiv:** [2507.12257](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/robust-causal-discovery-in-real-world-time-series-with-power-laws/16607)

#### Abstract
Exploring causal relationships in stochastic time series is a challenging yet crucial task with a vast range of applications, including finance, economics, neuroscience, and climate science. Many algorithms for Causal Discovery (CD) have been proposed, but they often exhibit a high sensitivity to noise, resulting in misleading causal inferences when applied to real data. In this paper, we observe that the frequency spectra of typical real-world time series follow a power-law distribution, notably due to an inherent self-organizing behavior. Leveraging this insight, we build a robust CD method based on the extraction of power -law spectral features that amplify genuine causal signals. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets with known causal structures, demonstrating its robustness and practical relevance.

### Beyond Pass@k: Breadth-Depth Metrics for Reasoning Boundaries
**Date:** 2025-10-10 | **Arxiv:** [2510.08325](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/beyond-pass-k-breadth-depth-metrics-for-reasoning-boundaries/16068)

#### Abstract
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

### When Thoughts Meet Facts: Reusable Reasoning for Long-Context LMs
**Date:** 2025-10-10 | **Arxiv:** [2510.07499](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/when-thoughts-meet-facts-reusable-reasoning-for-long-context-lms/16030)

#### Abstract
Recent Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs) can process hundreds of thousands of tokens in a single prompt, enabling new opportunities for knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning by integrating large sets of retrieved documents or, in some cases, directly all necessary information. However, simply feeding more documents into the context window fails to capture how evidence should be connected. We address this gap with thought templates, which recast reasoning as reusable thought caches, derived from prior problem solving traces, structuring how evidence is combined and guiding multi-hop inference with factual documents. To keep these templates effective, we propose an update strategy that iteratively refines templates derived from training data through natural-language feedback. Across diverse benchmarks and LCLM families, our approach delivers consistent gains over strong baselines in both retrieval-based and retrieval-free settings. Furthermore, we show that optimized templates can be distilled into smaller open-source models, demonstrating its broad applicability and transparent reasoning reuse. We refer to our framework as Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL).

### Conditional Local Independence Testing for It\^o processes with Applications to Dynamic Causal Discovery
**Date:** 2025-10-08 | **Arxiv:** [2506.07844](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/conditional-local-independence-testing-for-it-o-processes-with-applications-to-dynamic-causal-discovery/15543)

#### Abstract
Inferring causal relationships from dynamical systems is the central interest of many scientific inquiries. Conditional local independence, which describes whether the evolution of one process is influenced by another process given additional processes, is important for causal learning in such systems. In this paper, we propose a hypothesis test for conditional local independence in Itô processes. Our test is grounded in the semimartingale decomposition of the Itô process, with which we introduce a stochastic integral process that is a martingale under the null hypothesis. We then apply a test for the martingale property, quantifying potential deviation from local independence. The test statistics is estimated using the optimal filtering equation. We show the consistency of the estimation, thereby establishing the level and power of our test. Numerical verification and a real-world application to causal discovery in brain resting-state fMRIs are conducted.

### Exploring Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Steerable Pluralistic Alignment
**Date:** 2025-10-07 | **Arxiv:** [2510.04045](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/exploring-chain-of-thought-reasoning-for-steerable-pluralistic-alignment/15059)

#### Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained to reflect a relatively uniform set of values, which limits their applicability to tasks that require understanding of nuanced human perspectives. Recent research has underscored the importance of enabling LLMs to support steerable pluralism -- the capacity to adopt a specific perspective and align generated outputs with it. In this work, we investigate whether Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning techniques can be applied to building steerable pluralistic models. We explore several methods, including CoT prompting, fine-tuning on human-authored CoT, fine-tuning on synthetic explanations, and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We evaluate these approaches using the Value Kaleidoscope and OpinionQA datasets. Among the methods studied, RLVR consistently outperforms others and demonstrates strong training sample efficiency. We further analyze the generated CoT traces with respect to faithfulness and safety.

### Causal Abstractions, Categorically Unified
**Date:** 2025-10-07 | **Arxiv:** [2510.05033](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/causal-abstractions-categorically-unified/14689)

#### Abstract
We present a categorical framework for relating causal models that represent the same system at different levels of abstraction. We define a causal abstraction as natural transformations between appropriate Markov functors, which concisely consolidate desirable properties a causal abstraction should exhibit. Our approach unifies and generalizes previously considered causal abstractions, and we obtain categorical proofs and generalizations of existing results on causal abstractions. Using string diagrammatical tools, we can explicitly describe the graphs that serve as consistent abstractions of a low-level graph under interventions. We discuss how methods from mechanistic interpretability, such as circuit analysis and sparse autoencoders, fit within our categorical framework. We also show how applying do-calculus on a high-level graphical abstraction of an acyclic-directed mixed graph (ADMG), when unobserved confounders are present, gives valid results on the low-level graph, thus generalizing an earlier statement by Anand et al. (2023). We argue that our framework is more suitable for modeling causal abstractions compared to existing categorical frameworks. Finally, we discuss how notions such as $τ$-consistency and constructive $τ$-abstractions can be recovered with our framework.

### Uncertainty-Aware Answer Selection for Improved Reasoning in Multi-LLM Systems
**Date:** 2025-10-06 | **Arxiv:** [2510.02377](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/uncertainty-aware-answer-selection-for-improved-reasoning-in-multi-llm-systems/14532)

#### Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities, yet selecting the most reliable response from multiple LLMs remains a challenge, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Existing approaches often depend on costly external verifiers, human evaluators, or self-consistency techniques that require multiple samples from a single model. While multi-LLM systems produce more diverse responses than single models and thus have greater potential, they often underperform compared to single LLM self-consistency. We propose a principled, novel and computationally efficient method to select the best response from multiple different LLMs using a calibrated log-likelihood score, implicitly leveraging the inherent knowledge and confidence of these models. Our method demonstrates improvements of approx. 4%, 3%, and 5% across both debate (multi-round LLM discussions) and non-debate (Best-of-N with multiple LLMs) settings on GSM8K, MMLU (6 subsets), and ARC datasets respectively.

### KaVa: Latent Reasoning via Compressed KV-Cache Distillation
**Date:** 2025-10-03 | **Arxiv:** [2510.02312](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/kava-latent-reasoning-via-compressed-kv-cache-distillation/14198)

#### Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at multi-step reasoning problems with explicit chain-of-thought (CoT), but verbose traces incur significant computational costs and memory overhead, and often carry redundant, stylistic artifacts. Latent reasoning has emerged as an efficient alternative that internalizes the thought process, but it suffers from a critical lack of supervision, limiting its effectiveness on complex, natural-language reasoning traces. In this work, we propose KaVa, the first framework that bridges this gap by distilling knowledge directly from a compressed KV-cache of the teacher into a latent-reasoning student via self-distillation, leveraging the representational flexibility of continuous latent tokens to align stepwise KV trajectories. We show that the abstract, unstructured knowledge within compressed KV-cache, which lacks direct token correspondence, can serve as a rich supervisory signal for a latent reasoning student. Empirically, the approach consistently outperforms strong latent baselines, exhibits markedly smaller degradation from equation-only to natural-language traces, and scales to larger backbones while preserving efficiency. These results establish compressed KV-cache distillation as a scalable supervision signal for latent reasoning, combining the accuracy of CoT-trained teachers with the efficiency and deployability of latent inference.

### GRPO-$\lambda$: Credit Assignment improves LLM Reasoning
**Date:** 2025-10-02 | **Arxiv:** [2510.00194](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/grpo-lambda-credit-assignment-improves-llm-reasoning/13693)

#### Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for tasks requiring complex reasoning, prompting significant interest in improving their reasoning abilities through post-training. Especially RL based methods using verifiable reward, like the state-of-the-art GRPO, have shown to tremendously improve reasoning behaviors when applied as post-training methods. However, the lack of an explicit reward or critic model limits GRPO's ability to assign fine-grained credit across token sequences. In this work, we present GRPO-$λ$, a novel extension to GRPO that enhances credit assignment in RL finetuning of LLMs for complex reasoning tasks. We approximate learning from $λ$-return with a reformulation of eligibility traces using token-level log-probabilities applied after each sequence generation, and a novel critic-free approximation of the temporal-difference error. We introduce a few variations for the weighting of the $λ$-return, and their applications to the eligibility-trace, where all the variations provide significant gains over GRPO. We compare GRPO-$λ$ against GRPO by training models from 1.5B to 7B parameters on $4$ different math reasoning datasets. The training plots demonstrate 30-40% improved performance during RL training on both LLaMA-3.1 and Qwen-2.5 architectures. Finally, we show that with GRPO-$λ$, the resulting average performance on AIME24, Math500, OlympiadMath, MinervaMath, and AMC improves over GRPO by over $3$ points and a $4.5$ points improvement on the 7B model.

### Designing Ambiguity Sets for Distributionally Robust Optimization Using Structural Causal Optimal Transport
**Date:** 2025-10-02 | **Arxiv:** [2510.00599](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/designing-ambiguity-sets-for-distributionally-robust-optimization-using-structural-causal-optimal-transport/13784)

#### Abstract
Distributionally robust optimization tackles out-of-sample issues like overfitting and distribution shifts by adopting an adversarial approach over a range of possible data distributions, known as the ambiguity set. To balance conservatism and accuracy, these sets must include realistic probability distributions by leveraging information from the nominal distribution. Assuming that nominal distributions arise from a structural causal model with a directed acyclic graph $\mathcal{G}$ and structural equations, previous methods such as adapted and $\mathcal{G}$-causal optimal transport have only utilized causal graph information in designing ambiguity sets. In this work, we propose incorporating structural equations, which include causal graph information, to enhance ambiguity sets, resulting in more realistic distributions. We introduce structural causal optimal transport and its associated ambiguity set, demonstrating their advantages and connections to previous methods. A key benefit of our approach is a relaxed version, where a regularization term replaces the complex causal constraints, enabling an efficient algorithm via difference-of-convex programming to solve structural causal optimal transport. We also show that when structural information is absent and must be estimated, our approach remains effective and provides finite sample guarantees. Lastly, we address the radius of ambiguity sets, illustrating how our method overcomes the curse of dimensionality in optimal transport problems, achieving faster shrinkage with dimension-free order.

### Two-Stage Nuisance Function Estimation for Causal Mediation Analysis
**Date:** 2025-09-30 | **Arxiv:** [2404.00735](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/two-stage-nuisance-function-estimation-for-causal-mediation-analysis/12564)

#### Abstract
Tchetgen Tchetgen and Shpitser (2012) introduced an efficient, debiased, and robust influence function-based estimator for the mediation functional, which is the key component in mediation analysis. This estimator relies on the treatment, mediator, and outcome mean mechanisms. However, treating these three mechanisms as nuisance functions and fitting them as accurately as possible may not be the most effective approach. Instead, it is essential to identify the specific functionals and aspects of these mechanisms that impact the estimation of the mediation functional. In this work, we consider a specific reparametrization of the likelihood function that requires four nuisance functions. To estimate them, we propose a two-stage estimation strategy guided by the role of the nuisance functions in the bias structure of the influence function-based estimator. In particular, two of the functions are estimated using a novel nonparametric weighted balancing approach that directly targets the bias of the final mediation functional estimator. We show that the resulting estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal under certain conditions and attains multiple robustness against misspecifications of the nuisance functions. In simulations, our estimator demonstrated better stability and reduced bias and mean squared error compared to the original influence function-based estimator and a naive estimator. In an application to NHANES 2013-2014 data, our approach suggests that obesity results in a 60% higher odds of coronary heart disease, with roughly 35% higher odds attributable to the direct pathway independent of Glycohemoglobin.

### Probabilistic Soundness Guarantees in LLM Reasoning Chains
**Date:** 2025-09-30 | **Arxiv:** [2507.12948](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/probabilistic-soundness-guarantees-in-llm-reasoning-chains/13072)

#### Abstract
In reasoning chains generated by large language models (LLMs), initial errors often propagate and undermine the reliability of the final conclusion. Current LLM-based error detection methods often fail to detect propagated errors because earlier errors can corrupt judgments of downstream reasoning. To better detect such errors, we introduce Autoregressive Reasoning Entailment Stability (ARES), a probabilistic framework that evaluates each reasoning step based solely on previously-verified premises. This inductive method yields a nuanced score for each step and provides certified statistical guarantees of its soundness, rather than a brittle binary label. ARES achieves state-of-the-art performance across four benchmarks (72.1% Macro-F1, +8.2 points) and demonstrates superior robustness on very long synthetic reasoning chains, where it excels at detecting propagated errors (90.3% F1, +27.6 points).

### Comprehension Without Competence: Architectural Limits of LLMs in Symbolic Computation and Reasoning
**Date:** 2025-09-30 | **Arxiv:** [2507.10624](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/comprehension-without-competence-architectural-limits-of-llms-in-symbolic-computation-and-reasoning/13180)

#### Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) display striking surface fluency yet systematically fail at tasks requiring symbolic reasoning, arithmetic accuracy, and logical consistency. This paper offers a structural diagnosis of such failures, revealing a persistent gap between \textit{comprehension} and \textit{competence}. Through controlled experiments and architectural analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs often articulate correct principles without reliably applying them--a failure rooted not in knowledge access, but in computational execution. We term this phenomenon the computational \textit{split-brain syndrome}, where instruction and action pathways are geometrically and functionally dissociated. This core limitation recurs across domains, from mathematical operations to relational inferences, and explains why model behavior remains brittle even under idealized prompting. We argue that LLMs function as powerful pattern completion engines, but lack the architectural scaffolding for principled, compositional reasoning. Our findings delineate the boundary of current LLM capabilities and motivate future models with metacognitive control, principle lifting, and structurally grounded execution. This diagnosis also clarifies why mechanistic interpretability findings may reflect training-specific pattern coordination rather than universal computational principles, and why the geometric separation between instruction and execution pathways suggests limitations in neural introspection and mechanistic analysis.

### AceSearcher: Bootstrapping Reasoning and Search for LLMs via Reinforced Self-Play
**Date:** 2025-09-30 | **Arxiv:** [2509.24193](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/acesearcher-bootstrapping-reasoning-and-search-for-llms-via-reinforced-self-play/12875)

#### Abstract
Search-augmented LLMs often struggle with complex reasoning tasks due to ineffective multi-hop retrieval and limited reasoning ability. We propose AceSearcher, a cooperative self-play framework that trains a single large language model (LLM) to alternate between two roles: a decomposer that breaks down complex queries and a solver that integrates retrieved contexts for answer generation. AceSearcher couples supervised fine-tuning on a diverse mixture of search, reasoning, and decomposition tasks with reinforcement fine-tuning optimized for final answer accuracy, eliminating the need for intermediate annotations. Extensive experiments on three reasoning-intensive tasks across 10 datasets show that AceSearcher outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average exact match improvement of 7.6%. Remarkably, on document-level finance reasoning tasks, AceSearcher-32B matches the performance of the DeepSeek-V3 model using less than 5% of its parameters. Even at smaller scales (1.5B and 8B), AceSearcher often surpasses existing search-augmented LLMs with up to 9x more parameters, highlighting its exceptional efficiency and effectiveness in tackling complex reasoning tasks. Our code will be published at https://github.com/ritaranx/AceSearcher and https://huggingface.co/AceSearcher.

### On the Design of KL-Regularized Policy Gradient Algorithms for LLM Reasoning
**Date:** 2025-09-30 | **Arxiv:** [2505.17508](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/on-the-design-of-kl-regularized-policy-gradient-algorithms-for-llm-reasoning/13021)

#### Abstract
Policy gradient algorithms have been successfully applied to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). KL regularization is ubiquitous, yet the design surface, choice of KL direction (forward vs. reverse), normalization (normalized vs. unnormalized), and estimator ($k_1/k_2/k_3$), is scattered across the literature and often intertwined with off-policy estimation. We ask a focused question: under the off-policy setting, what weighting is required for each KL variant so that the surrogate we optimize yields the exact gradient of the intended KL-regularized objective? We answer this with a compact, unified derivation we call the Regularized Policy Gradient (RPG) view. RPG (i) unifies normalized and unnormalized KL variants and shows that the widely-used $k_3$ penalty is exactly the unnormalized KL; (ii) specifies conditions under which REINFORCE-style losses with stop-gradient are gradient-equivalent to fully differentiable surrogates; (iii) identifies and corrects an off-policy importance-weighting mismatch in GRPO's KL term; and (iv) introduces RPG-Style Clip, a clipped-importance-sampling step within RPG-REINFORCE that enables stable, off-policy policy-gradient training at scale. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25), RPG-REINFORCE with RPG-Style Clip improves accuracy by up to $+6$ absolute percentage points over DAPO. We extend our experiments to 8K context length, and RPG-REINFORCE with RPG-Style Clip achieves 52% accuracy on AIME25, surpassing the official Qwen3-4B-Instruct model (47%). Notably, RPG is a stable and scalable RL algorithm for LLM reasoning, realized via (a) a KL-correct objective, (b) clipped importance sampling, and (c) an iterative reference-policy update scheme.

### Causal Abstraction Inference under Lossy Representations
**Date:** 2025-09-29 | **Arxiv:** [2509.21607](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/causal-abstraction-inference-under-lossy-representations/11957)

#### Abstract
The study of causal abstractions bridges two integral components of human intelligence: the ability to determine cause and effect, and the ability to interpret complex patterns into abstract concepts. Formally, causal abstraction frameworks define connections between complicated low-level causal models and simple high-level ones. One major limitation of most existing definitions is that they are not well-defined when considering lossy abstraction functions in which multiple low-level interventions can have different effects while mapping to the same high-level intervention (an assumption called the abstract invariance condition). In this paper, we introduce a new type of abstractions called projected abstractions that generalize existing definitions to accommodate lossy representations. We show how to construct a projected abstraction from the low-level model and how it translates equivalent observational, interventional, and counterfactual causal queries from low to high-level. Given that the true model is rarely available in practice we prove a new graphical criteria for identifying and estimating high-level causal queries from limited low-level data. Finally, we experimentally show the effectiveness of projected abstraction models in high-dimensional image settings.

### Dynamic Experts Search: Enhancing Reasoning in Mixture-of-Experts LLMs at Test Time
**Date:** 2025-09-29 | **Arxiv:** [2509.22572](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/dynamic-experts-search-enhancing-reasoning-in-mixture-of-experts-llms-at-test-time/12215)

#### Abstract
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) enhances the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation during inference. However, existing approaches primarily rely on output-level sampling while overlooking the role of model architecture. In mainstream Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs, we observe that varying the number of activated experts yields complementary solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing a new and underexplored source of diversity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search (DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllable dimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) Dynamic MoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) Expert Configuration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within a reasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability and diversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoE architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (i.e., math, code and knowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing accuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES as a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating how structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning.

### Navigate the Unknown: Enhancing LLM Reasoning with Intrinsic Motivation Guided Exploration
**Date:** 2025-09-29 | **Arxiv:** [2505.17621](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/navigate-the-unknown-enhancing-llm-reasoning-with-intrinsic-motivation-guided-exploration/12271)

#### Abstract
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal method for improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevalent RL approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group-Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical limitations due to their reliance on sparse outcome-based rewards and inadequate mechanisms for incentivizing exploration. These limitations result in inefficient guidance for reasoning. Specifically, sparse rewards fail to deliver sufficient feedback, particularly for challenging problems. Furthermore, such rewards induce systematic biases that prioritize exploitation of familiar trajectories over novel solution discovery. These shortcomings critically hinder performance in complex reasoning tasks, which inherently demand iterative refinement across intermediate steps. To address these challenges, we propose an Intrinsic Motivation guidEd exploratioN meThOd foR LLM Reasoning (i-MENTOR), a method designed to deliver dense rewards and amplify exploration in the RL-based paradigm. i-MENTOR introduces three innovations: trajectory-aware exploration rewards that mitigate bias in token-level strategies while maintaining computational efficiency; error-conditioned reward allocation to ensure efficient exploration on challenging samples while intrinsically stabilizing training; and advantage-preserving integration that maintains advantage distribution integrity while incorporating exploratory guidance. Experiments across 4 public datasets demonstrate i-MENTOR's effectiveness, achieving a 22.23\% improvement on AIME 2024.

### Talking Trees: Reasoning-Assisted Induction of Decision Trees for Tabular Data
**Date:** 2025-09-29 | **Arxiv:** [2509.21465](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/talking-trees-reasoning-assisted-induction-of-decision-trees-for-tabular-data/11913)

#### Abstract
Tabular foundation models are becoming increasingly popular for low-resource tabular problems. These models make up for small training datasets by pretraining on large volumes of synthetic data. The prior knowledge obtained via pretraining provides the exceptional performance, but the resulting model becomes a black box that is difficult to interpret and costly to inference. In this work, we explore an alternative strategy: using reasoning-capable LLMs to induce decision trees for small tabular datasets in agentic setup. We design a minimal set of tools for constructing, analyzing and manipulating decision trees. By using these tools, LLMs combine their prior knowledge with learning from data to create a lightweight decision tree that outperforms traditional CART on low-resource tabular problems. While a single decision tree does not outperform state-of-the-art black box models, it comes with a human-readable reasoning trace that can be checked for biases and data leaks. Furthermore, the reasoning-based LLM's creation process allows for additional human input: correcting biases or incorporating domain-specific intuition that is not captured in the data.

### ScaleDiff: Scaling Difficult Problems for Advanced Mathematical Reasoning
**Date:** 2025-09-26 | **Arxiv:** [2509.21070](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/scalediff-scaling-difficult-problems-for-advanced-mathematical-reasoning/11700)

#### Abstract
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex problem-solving, often benefiting from training on difficult mathematical problems that stimulate intricate reasoning. Recent efforts have explored automated synthesis of mathematical problems by prompting proprietary models or large-scale open-source models from seed data or inherent mathematical concepts. However, scaling up these methods remains challenging due to their high computational/API cost, complexity of prompting, and limited difficulty level of the generated problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose ScaleDiff, a simple yet effective pipeline designed to scale the creation of difficult problems. We efficiently identify difficult problems from existing datasets with only a single forward pass using an adaptive thinking model, which can perceive problem difficulty and automatically switch between "Thinking" and "NoThinking" modes. We then train a specialized difficult problem generator (DiffGen-8B) on this filtered difficult data, which can produce new difficult problems in large scale, eliminating the need for complex, per-instance prompting and its associated high API costs. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields a substantial performance increase of 11.3% compared to the original dataset and achieves a 65.9% average accuracy on AIME'24, AIME'25, HMMT-Feb'25, BRUMO'25, and MATH500, outperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3. Notably, this performance is achieved using the cost-efficient Qwen3-8B model as a teacher, demonstrating that our pipeline can effectively transfer advanced reasoning capabilities without relying on larger, more expensive teacher models. Furthermore, we observe a clear scaling phenomenon in model performance on difficult benchmarks as the quantity of difficult problems increases. Code: https://github.com/QizhiPei/ScaleDiff.

### Consistent causal discovery with equal error variances: a least-squares perspective
**Date:** 2025-09-19 | **Arxiv:** [2509.15197](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/consistent-causal-discovery-with-equal-error-variances-a-least-squares-perspective/10038)

#### Abstract
We consider the problem of recovering the true causal structure among a set of variables, generated by a linear acyclic structural equation model (SEM) with the error terms being independent and having equal variances. It is well-known that the true underlying directed acyclic graph (DAG) encoding the causal structure is uniquely identifiable under this assumption. In this work, we establish that the sum of minimum expected squared errors for every variable, while predicted by the best linear combination of its parent variables, is minimised if and only if the causal structure is represented by any supergraph of the true DAG. This property is further utilised to design a Bayesian DAG selection method that recovers the true graph consistently.

### DAG: A Dual Causal Network for Time Series Forecasting with Exogenous Variables
**Date:** 2025-09-19 | **Arxiv:** [2509.14933](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/dag-a-dual-causal-network-for-time-series-forecasting-with-exogenous-variables/10076)

#### Abstract
Time series forecasting is crucial in various fields such as economics, traffic, and AIOps. However, in real-world applications, focusing solely on the endogenous variables (i.e., target variables), is often insufficient to ensure accurate predictions. Considering exogenous variables (i.e., covariates) provides additional predictive information, thereby improving forecasting accuracy. However, existing methods for time series forecasting with exogenous variables (TSF-X) have the following shortcomings: 1) they do not leverage future exogenous variables, 2) they fail to account for the causal relationships between endogenous and exogenous variables. As a result, their performance is suboptimal. In this study, to better leverage exogenous variables, especially future exogenous variable, we propose a general framework DAG, which utilizes dual causal network along both the temporal and channel dimensions for time series forecasting with exogenous variables. Specifically, we first introduce the Temporal Causal Module, which includes a causal discovery module to capture how historical exogenous variables affect future exogenous variables. Following this, we construct a causal injection module that incorporates the discovered causal relationships into the process of forecasting future endogenous variables based on historical endogenous variables. Next, we propose the Channel Causal Module, which follows a similar design principle. It features a causal discovery module models how historical exogenous variables influence historical endogenous variables, and a causal injection module incorporates the discovered relationships to enhance the prediction of future endogenous variables based on future exogenous variables.

### The Honest Truth About Causal Trees: Accuracy Limits for Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation
**Date:** 2025-09-16 | **Arxiv:** [2509.11381](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/the-honest-truth-about-causal-trees-accuracy-limits-for-heterogeneous-treatment-effect-estimation/9422)

#### Abstract
Recursive decision trees have emerged as a leading methodology for heterogeneous causal treatment effect estimation and inference in experimental and observational settings. These procedures are fitted using the celebrated CART (Classification And Regression Tree) algorithm [Breiman et al., 1984], or custom variants thereof, and hence are believed to be "adaptive" to high-dimensional data, sparsity, or other specific features of the underlying data generating process. Athey and Imbens [2016] proposed several "honest" causal decision tree estimators, which have become the standard in both academia and industry. We study their estimators, and variants thereof, and establish lower bounds on their estimation error. We demonstrate that these popular heterogeneous treatment effect estimators cannot achieve a polynomial-in-$n$ convergence rate under basic conditions, where $n$ denotes the sample size. Contrary to common belief, honesty does not resolve these limitations and at best delivers negligible logarithmic improvements in sample size or dimension. As a result, these commonly used estimators can exhibit poor performance in practice, and even be inconsistent in some settings. Our theoretical insights are empirically validated through simulations.

### Unearthing Gems from Stones: Policy Optimization with Negative Sample Augmentation for LLM Reasoning
**Date:** 2025-09-16 | **Arxiv:** [2505.14403](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/unearthing-gems-from-stones-policy-optimization-with-negative-sample-augmentation-for-llm-reasoning/9735)

#### Abstract
Recent advances in reasoning language models have witnessed a paradigm shift from short to long CoT pattern. Given the substantial computational cost of rollouts in long CoT models, maximizing the utility of fixed training datasets becomes crucial. Our analysis reveals that negative responses contain valuable components such as self-reflection and error-correction steps, yet primary existing methods either completely discard negative samples (RFT) or apply equal penalization across all tokens (RL), failing to leverage these potential learning signals. In light of this, we propose Behavior Constrained Policy Gradient with Negative Sample Augmentation (BCPG-NSA), a fine-grained offline RL framework that encompasses three stages: 1) sample segmentation, 2) consensus-based step correctness assessment combining LLM and PRM judgers, and 3) policy optimization with NSA designed to effectively mine positive steps within negative samples. Experimental results show that BCPG-NSA outperforms baselines on several challenging math/coding reasoning benchmarks using the same training dataset, achieving improved sample efficiency and demonstrating robustness and scalability when extended to multiple iterations.

### CogGuide: Human-Like Guidance for Zero-Shot Omni-Modal Reasoning
**Date:** 2025-09-09 | **Arxiv:** [2509.06641](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/cogguide-human-like-guidance-for-zero-shot-omni-modal-reasoning/8473)

#### Abstract
Targeting the issues of "shortcuts" and insufficient contextual understanding in complex cross-modal reasoning of multimodal large models, this paper proposes a zero-shot multimodal reasoning component guided by human-like cognitive strategies centered on an "intent sketch". The component comprises a plug-and-play three-module pipeline-Intent Perceiver, Strategy Generator, and Strategy Selector-that explicitly constructs a "understand-plan-select" cognitive process. By generating and filtering "intent sketch" strategies to guide the final reasoning, it requires no parameter fine-tuning and achieves cross-model transfer solely through in-context engineering. Information-theoretic analysis shows that this process can reduce conditional entropy and improve information utilization efficiency, thereby suppressing unintended shortcut reasoning. Experiments on IntentBench, WorldSense, and Daily-Omni validate the method's generality and robust gains; compared with their respective baselines, the complete "three-module" scheme yields consistent improvements across different reasoning engines and pipeline combinations, with gains up to approximately 9.51 percentage points, demonstrating the practical value and portability of the "intent sketch" reasoning component in zero-shot scenarios.

### CRANE: Reasoning with constrained LLM generation
**Date:** 2025-09-08 | **Arxiv:** [2502.09061](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/crane-reasoning-with-constrained-llm-generation/8200)

#### Abstract
Code generation, symbolic math reasoning, and other tasks require LLMs to produce outputs that are both syntactically and semantically correct. Constrained LLM generation is a promising direction to enforce adherence to formal grammar, but prior works have empirically observed that strict enforcement of formal constraints often diminishes the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. In this work, we first provide a theoretical explanation for why constraining LLM outputs to very restrictive grammars that only allow syntactically valid final answers reduces the reasoning capabilities of the model. Second, we demonstrate that by augmenting the output grammar with carefully designed additional rules, it is always possible to preserve the reasoning capabilities of the LLM while ensuring syntactic and semantic correctness in its outputs. Building on these theoretical insights, we propose a reasoning-augmented constrained decoding algorithm, CRANE, which effectively balances the correctness of constrained generation with the flexibility of unconstrained generation. Experiments on multiple open-source LLMs and benchmarks show that CRANE significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art constrained decoding strategies and standard unconstrained decoding, showing up to 10% points accuracy improvement over baselines on challenging symbolic reasoning benchmarks GSM-symbolic and FOLIO.

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer natural language explanations as an alternative to feature attribution methods for model interpretability. However, despite their plausibility, they may not reflect the model's true reasoning faithfully, which is crucial for understanding the model's true decision-making processes. Although several faithfulness metrics have been proposed, they are often evaluated in isolation, making direct, principled comparisons between them difficult. Here, we present Causal Diagnosticity, a framework that serves as a common testbed to evaluate faithfulness metrics for natural language explanations. Our framework employs the concept of diagnosticity, and uses model-editing methods to generate faithful-unfaithful explanation pairs. Our benchmark includes four tasks: fact-checking, analogy, object counting, and multi-hop reasoning. We evaluate prominent faithfulness metrics, including post-hoc explanation and chain-of-thought-based methods. We find that diagnostic performance varies across tasks and models, with Filler Tokens performing best overall. Additionally, continuous metrics are generally more diagnostic than binary ones but can be sensitive to noise and model choice. Our results highlight the need for more robust faithfulness metrics.

### Beyond Memorization: Extending Reasoning Depth with Recurrence, Memory and Test-Time Compute Scaling
**Date:** 2025-08-26 | **Arxiv:** [2508.16745](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/beyond-memorization-extending-reasoning-depth-with-recurrence-memory-and-test-time-compute-scaling/5774)

#### Abstract
Reasoning is a core capability of large language models, yet understanding how they learn and perform multi-step reasoning remains an open problem. In this study, we explore how different architectures and training methods affect model multi-step reasoning capabilities within a cellular automata framework. By training on state sequences generated with random Boolean functions for random initial conditions to exclude memorization, we demonstrate that most neural architectures learn to abstract the underlying rules. While models achieve high accuracy in next-state prediction, their performance declines sharply if multi-step reasoning is required. We confirm that increasing model depth plays a crucial role for sequential computations. We demonstrate that an extension of the effective model depth with recurrence, memory, and test-time compute scaling substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.

### MMTU: A Massive Multi-Task Table Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark
**Date:** 2025-08-26 | **Arxiv:** [2506.05587](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/mmtu-a-massive-multi-task-table-understanding-and-reasoning-benchmark/6118)

#### Abstract
Tables and table-based use cases play a crucial role in many important real-world applications, such as spreadsheets, databases, and computational notebooks, which traditionally require expert-level users like data engineers, data analysts, and database administrators to operate. Although LLMs have shown remarkable progress in working with tables (e.g., in spreadsheet and database copilot scenarios), comprehensive benchmarking of such capabilities remains limited. In contrast to an extensive and growing list of NLP benchmarks, evaluations of table-related tasks are scarce, and narrowly focus on tasks like NL-to-SQL and Table-QA, overlooking the broader spectrum of real-world tasks that professional users face. This gap limits our understanding and model progress in this important area.   In this work, we introduce MMTU, a large-scale benchmark with over 28K questions across 25 real-world table tasks, designed to comprehensively evaluate models ability to understand, reason, and manipulate real tables at the expert-level. These tasks are drawn from decades' worth of computer science research on tabular data, with a focus on complex table tasks faced by professional users. We show that MMTU require a combination of skills -- including table understanding, reasoning, and coding -- that remain challenging for today's frontier models, where even frontier reasoning models like OpenAI GPT-5 and DeepSeek R1 score only around 69\% and 57\% respectively, suggesting significant room for improvement. We highlight key findings in our evaluation using MMTU and hope that this benchmark drives further advances in understanding and developing foundation models for structured data processing and analysis.

### A Toolbox, Not a Hammer -- Multi-TAG: Scaling Math Reasoning with Multi-Tool Aggregation
**Date:** 2025-08-25 | **Arxiv:** [2507.18973](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/a-toolbox-not-a-hammer-multi-tag-scaling-math-reasoning-with-multi-tool-aggregation/5705)

#### Abstract
Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools is a promising avenue for developing high-performance mathematical reasoning systems. Prior tool-augmented approaches typically finetune an LLM to select and invoke a single tool at each reasoning step and show promising results on simpler math reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K. However, these approaches struggle with more complex math problems that require precise reasoning over multiple steps. To address this limitation, in this work, we propose Multi-TAG, a Multi-Tool AGgregation-based framework. Instead of relying on a single tool, Multi-TAG guides an LLM to concurrently invoke multiple tools at each reasoning step. It then aggregates their diverse outputs to verify and refine the reasoning process, enhancing solution robustness and accuracy. Notably, Multi-TAG is a finetuning-free, inference-only framework, making it readily applicable to any LLM backbone, including large open-weight models which are computationally expensive to finetune and proprietary frontier models which cannot be finetuned with custom recipes. We evaluate Multi-TAG on four challenging benchmarks: MATH500, AIME, AMC, and OlympiadBench. Across both open-weight and closed-source LLM backbones, Multi-TAG consistently and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 6.0% to 7.5% over state-of-the-art baselines.

### Technical Report: Facilitating the Adoption of Causal Inference Methods Through LLM-Empowered Co-Pilot
**Date:** 2025-08-15 | **Arxiv:** [2508.10581](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/technical-report-facilitating-the-adoption-of-causal-inference-methods-through-llm-empowered-co-pilot/3807)

#### Abstract
Estimating treatment effects (TE) from observational data is a critical yet complex task in many fields, from healthcare and economics to public policy. While recent advances in machine learning and causal inference have produced powerful estimation techniques, their adoption remains limited due to the need for deep expertise in causal assumptions, adjustment strategies, and model selection. In this paper, we introduce CATE-B, an open-source co-pilot system that uses large language models (LLMs) within an agentic framework to guide users through the end-to-end process of treatment effect estimation. CATE-B assists in (i) constructing a structural causal model via causal discovery and LLM-based edge orientation, (ii) identifying robust adjustment sets through a novel Minimal Uncertainty Adjustment Set criterion, and (iii) selecting appropriate regression methods tailored to the causal structure and dataset characteristics. To encourage reproducibility and evaluation, we release a suite of benchmark tasks spanning diverse domains and causal complexities. By combining causal inference with intelligent, interactive assistance, CATE-B lowers the barrier to rigorous causal analysis and lays the foundation for a new class of benchmarks in automated treatment effect estimation.

### Beyond Scaling Law: A Data-Efficient Distillation Framework for Reasoning
**Date:** 2025-08-14 | **Arxiv:** [2508.09883](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/beyond-scaling-law-a-data-efficient-distillation-framework-for-reasoning/3563)

#### Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities in tasks such as algorithmic coding and mathematical problem-solving. Recent methods have improved reasoning through expanded corpus and multistage training combining reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. Although some methods suggest that small but targeted dataset can incentivize reasoning via only distillation, a reasoning scaling laws is still taking shape, increasing computational costs. To address this, we propose a data-efficient distillation framework (DED) that optimizes the Pareto frontier of reasoning distillation. Inspired by the on-policy learning and diverse roll-out strategies of reinforcement learning, the key idea of our approach is threefold: (1) We identify that benchmark scores alone do not determine an effective teacher model. Through comprehensive comparisons of leading reasoning LLMs, we develop a method to select an optimal teacher model. (2) While scaling distillation can enhance reasoning, it often degrades out-of-domain performance. A carefully curated, smaller corpus achieves a balanced trade-off between in-domain and out-of-domain capabilities. (3) Diverse reasoning trajectories encourage the student model to develop robust reasoning skills. We validate our method through evaluations on mathematical reasoning (AIME 2024/2025, MATH-500) and code generation (LiveCodeBench), achieving state-of-the-art results with only 0.8k carefully curated examples, bypassing the need for extensive scaling. Our systematic analysis demonstrates that DED outperforms existing methods by considering factors beyond superficial hardness, token length, or teacher model capability. This work offers a practical and efficient pathway to advanced reasoning while preserving general capabilities.

### Differentiable Cyclic Causal Discovery Under Unmeasured Confounders
**Date:** 2025-08-13 | **Arxiv:** [2508.08450](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/differentiable-cyclic-causal-discovery-under-unmeasured-confounders/3224)

#### Abstract
Understanding causal relationships between variables is fundamental across scientific disciplines. Most causal discovery algorithms rely on two key assumptions: (i) all variables are observed, and (ii) the underlying causal graph is acyclic. While these assumptions simplify theoretical analysis, they are often violated in real-world systems, such as biological networks. Existing methods that account for confounders either assume linearity or struggle with scalability. To address these limitations, we propose DCCD-CONF, a novel framework for differentiable learning of nonlinear cyclic causal graphs in the presence of unmeasured confounders using interventional data. Our approach alternates between optimizing the graph structure and estimating the confounder distribution by maximizing the log-likelihood of the data. Through experiments on synthetic data and real-world gene perturbation datasets, we show that DCCD-CONF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both causal graph recovery and confounder identification. Additionally, we also provide consistency guarantees for our framework, reinforcing its theoretical soundness.

### Klear-Reasoner: Advancing Reasoning Capability via Gradient-Preserving Clipping Policy Optimization
**Date:** 2025-08-12 | **Arxiv:** [2508.07629](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/klear-reasoner-advancing-reasoning-capability-via-gradient-preserving-clipping-policy-optimization/2887)

#### Abstract
We present Klear-Reasoner, a model with long reasoning capabilities that demonstrates careful deliberation during problem solving, achieving outstanding performance across multiple benchmarks. Although there are already many excellent works related to inference models in the current community, there are still many problems with reproducing high-performance inference models due to incomplete disclosure of training details. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the reasoning model, covering the entire post-training workflow from data preparation and long Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning (long CoT SFT) to reinforcement learning (RL), along with detailed ablation studies for each experimental component. For SFT data, our experiments show that a small number of high-quality data sources are more effective than a large number of diverse data sources, and that difficult samples can achieve better results without accuracy filtering. In addition, we investigate two key issues with current clipping mechanisms in RL: Clipping suppresses critical exploration signals and ignores suboptimal trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose Gradient-Preserving clipping Policy Optimization (GPPO) that gently backpropagates gradients from clipped tokens. GPPO not only enhances the model's exploration capacity but also improves its efficiency in learning from negative samples. Klear-Reasoner exhibits exceptional reasoning abilities in mathematics and programming, scoring 90.5% on AIME 2024, 83.2% on AIME 2025, 66.0% on LiveCodeBench V5 and 58.1% on LiveCodeBench V6.

### Part I: Tricks or Traps? A Deep Dive into RL for LLM Reasoning
**Date:** 2025-08-12 | **Arxiv:** [2508.08221](https://hub.bitwiki.org/t/part-i-tricks-or-traps-a-deep-dive-into-rl-for-llm-reasoning/2936)

#### Abstract
Reinforcement learning for LLM reasoning has rapidly emerged as a prominent research area, marked by a significant surge in related studies on both algorithmic innovations and practical applications. Despite this progress, several critical challenges remain, including the absence of standardized guidelines for employing RL techniques and a fragmented understanding of their underlying mechanisms. Additionally, inconsistent experimental settings, variations in training data, and differences in model initialization have led to conflicting conclusions, obscuring the key characteristics of these techniques and creating confusion among practitioners when selecting appropriate techniques. This paper systematically reviews widely adopted RL techniques through rigorous reproductions and isolated evaluations within a unified open-source framework. We analyze the internal mechanisms, applicable scenarios, and core principles of each technique through fine-grained experiments, including datasets of varying difficulty, model sizes, and architectures. Based on these insights, we present clear guidelines for selecting RL techniques tailored to specific setups, and provide a reliable roadmap for practitioners navigating the RL for the LLM domain. Finally, we reveal that a minimalist combination of two techniques can unlock the learning capability of critic-free policies using vanilla PPO loss. The results demonstrate that our simple combination consistently improves performance, surpassing strategies like GRPO and DAPO.
