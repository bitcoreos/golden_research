### HyMaTE: A Hybrid Mamba and Transformer Model for EHR Representation Learning
**Date:** 2025-09-30 | **Arxiv:** [2509.24118](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24118)

#### Abstract
Electronic health Records (EHRs) have become a cornerstone in modern-day healthcare. They are a crucial part for analyzing the progression of patient health; however, their complexity, characterized by long, multivariate sequences, sparsity, and missing values poses significant challenges in traditional deep learning modeling. While Transformer-based models have demonstrated success in modeling EHR data and predicting clinical outcomes, their quadratic computational complexity and limited context length hinder their efficiency and practical applications. On the other hand, State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba present a promising alternative offering linear-time sequence modeling and improved efficiency for handling long sequences, but focus mostly on mixing sequence-level information rather than channel-level data. To overcome these challenges, we propose HyMaTE (A Hybrid Mamba and Transformer Model for EHR Representation Learning), a novel hybrid model tailored for representing longitudinal data, combining the strengths of SSMs with advanced attention mechanisms. By testing the model on predictive tasks on multiple clinical datasets, we demonstrate HyMaTE's ability to capture an effective, richer, and more nuanced unified representation of EHR data. Additionally, the interpretability of the outcomes achieved by self-attention illustrates the effectiveness of our model as a scalable and generalizable solution for real-world healthcare applications.

### Assessment of the conditional exchangeability assumption in causal machine learning models: a simulation study
**Date:** 2025-10-31 | **Arxiv:** [2510.26700](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26700)

#### Abstract
Observational studies developing causal machine learning (ML) models for the prediction of individualized treatment effects (ITEs) seldom conduct empirical evaluations to assess the conditional exchangeability assumption. We aimed to evaluate the performance of these models under conditional exchangeability violations and the utility of negative control outcomes (NCOs) as a diagnostic. We conducted a simulation study to examine confounding bias in ITE estimates generated by causal forest and X-learner models under varying conditions, including the presence or absence of true heterogeneity. We simulated data to reflect real-world scenarios with differing levels of confounding, sample size, and NCO confounding structures. We then estimated and compared subgroup-level treatment effects on the primary outcome and NCOs across settings with and without unmeasured confounding. When conditional exchangeability was violated, causal forest and X-learner models failed to recover true treatment effect heterogeneity and, in some cases, falsely indicated heterogeneity when there was none. NCOs successfully identified subgroups affected by unmeasured confounding. Even when NCOs did not perfectly satisfy its ideal assumptions, it remained informative, flagging potential bias in subgroup level estimates, though not always pinpointing the subgroup with the largest confounding. Violations of conditional exchangeability substantially limit the validity of ITE estimates from causal ML models in routinely collected observational data. NCOs serve a useful empirical diagnostic tool for detecting subgroup-specific unmeasured confounding and should be incorporated into causal ML workflows to support the credibility of individualized inference.

### GPU Memory Requirement Prediction for Deep Learning Task Based on Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit Optimization Transformer
**Date:** 2025-10-27 | **Arxiv:** [2510.20985](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20985)

#### Abstract
In response to the increasingly critical demand for accurate prediction of GPU memory resources in deep learning tasks, this paper deeply analyzes the current research status and innovatively proposes a deep learning model that integrates bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) to optimize the Transformer architecture, aiming to improve the accuracy of memory demand prediction. To verify the effectiveness of the model, a carefully designed comparative experiment was conducted, selecting four representative basic machine learning models: decision tree, random forest, Adaboost, and XGBoost as benchmarks. The detailed experimental results show that the BiGRU Transformer optimization model proposed in this paper exhibits significant advantages in key evaluation indicators: in terms of mean square error (MSE) and root mean square error (RMSE), the model achieves the lowest value among all comparison models, and its predicted results have the smallest deviation from the actual values; In terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination (R2) indicators, the model also performs well and the results are balanced and stable, with comprehensive predictive performance far exceeding the benchmark machine learning methods compared. In summary, the Transformer model based on bidirectional gated recurrent unit optimization successfully constructed in this study can efficiently and accurately complete GPU memory demand prediction tasks in deep learning tasks, and its prediction accuracy has been significantly improved compared to traditional machine learning methods. This research provides strong technical support and reliable theoretical basis for optimizing resource scheduling and management of deep learning tasks, and improving the utilization efficiency of computing clusters.

### Controllability Analysis of State Space-based Language Model
**Date:** 2025-11-25 | **Arxiv:** [2511.17970](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17970)

#### Abstract
State-space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have become powerful architectures for sequence modeling, yet their internal dynamics remain poorly understood compared to attention-based models. We introduce and validate the Influence Score, a controllability-based metric derived from the discretized state-space parameters of Mamba and computed through a backward recurrence analogous to system observability. The score quantifies how strongly a token at position k affects all later states and outputs. We evaluate this measure across three Mamba variants: mamba-130m, mamba-2.8b, and mamba-2.8b-slimpj, using six experiments that test its sensitivity to temperature, prompt complexity, token type, layer depth, token position, and input perturbations. The results show three main insights: (1) the Influence Score increases with model size and training data, reflecting model capacity; (2) Mamba exhibits consistent architectural patterns, including recency bias and concentrated influence in mid-to-late layers; and (3) emergent behaviors appear only at scale, with mamba-2.8b-slimpj uniquely prioritizing content words and reducing internal influence in the presence of noise. These findings establish the Influence Score as a practical diagnostic tool for interpreting and comparing SSM-based language models.

### BiPETE: A Bi-Positional Embedding Transformer Encoder for Risk Assessment of Alcohol and Substance Use Disorder with Electronic Health Records
**Date:** 2025-11-10 | **Arxiv:** [2511.04998](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04998)

#### Abstract
Transformer-based deep learning models have shown promise for disease risk prediction using electronic health records(EHRs), but modeling temporal dependencies remains a key challenge due to irregular visit intervals and lack of uniform structure. We propose a Bi-Positional Embedding Transformer Encoder or BiPETE for single-disease prediction, which integrates rotary positional embeddings to encode relative visit timing and sinusoidal embeddings to preserve visit order. Without relying on large-scale pretraining, BiPETE is trained on EHR data from two mental health cohorts-depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-to predict the risk of alcohol and substance use disorders (ASUD). BiPETE outperforms baseline models, improving the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) by 34% and 50% in the depression and PTSD cohorts, respectively. An ablation study further confirms the effectiveness of the dual positional encoding strategy. We apply the Integrated Gradients method to interpret model predictions, identifying key clinical features associated with ASUD risk and protection, such as abnormal inflammatory, hematologic, and metabolic markers, as well as specific medications and comorbidities. Overall, these key clinical features identified by the attribution methods contribute to a deeper understanding of the risk assessment process and offer valuable clues for mitigating potential risks. In summary, our study presents a practical and interpretable framework for disease risk prediction using EHR data, which can achieve strong performance.

### Dispersion based Recurrent Neural Network Model for Methane Monitoring in Albertan Tailings Ponds
**Date:** 2025-11-07 | **Arxiv:** [2411.06741](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06741)

#### Abstract
Bitumen extraction for the production of synthetic crude oil in Canada's Athabasca Oil Sands industry has recently come under spotlight for being a significant source of greenhouse gas emission. A major cause of concern is methane, a greenhouse gas produced by the anaerobic biodegradation of hydrocarbons in oil sands residues, or tailings, stored in settle basins commonly known as oil sands tailing ponds. In order to determine the methane emitting potential of these tailing ponds and have future methane projections, we use real-time weather data, mechanistic models developed from laboratory controlled experiments, and industrial reports to train a physics constrained machine learning model. Our trained model can successfully identify the directions of active ponds and estimate their emission levels, which are generally hard to obtain due to data sampling restrictions. We found that each active oil sands tailing pond could emit between 950 to 1500 tonnes of methane per year, whose environmental impact is equivalent to carbon dioxide emissions from at least 6000 gasoline powered vehicles. Although abandoned ponds are often presumed to have insignificant emissions, our findings indicate that these ponds could become active over time and potentially emit up to 1000 tonnes of methane each year. Taking an average over all datasets that was used in model training, we estimate that emissions around major oil sands regions would need to be reduced by approximately 12% over a year, to reduce the average methane concentrations to 2005 levels.

### Data Efficient Any Transformer-to-Mamba Distillation via Attention Bridge
**Date:** 2025-10-23 | **Arxiv:** [2510.19266](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19266)

#### Abstract
State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformers for sequence modeling, offering superior scalability through recurrent structures. However, their training remains costly and the ecosystem around them is far less mature than that of Transformers. Moreover, the structural heterogeneity between SSMs and Transformers makes it challenging to efficiently distill knowledge from pretrained attention models. In this work, we propose Cross-architecture distillation via Attention Bridge (CAB), a novel data-efficient distillation framework that efficiently transfers attention knowledge from Transformer teachers to state-space student models. Unlike conventional knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge only at the output level, CAB enables token-level supervision via a lightweight bridge and flexible layer-wise alignment, improving both efficiency and transferability. We further introduce flexible layer-wise alignment strategies to accommodate architectural discrepancies between teacher and student. Extensive experiments across vision and language domains demonstrate that our method consistently improves the performance of state-space models, even under limited training data, outperforming both standard and cross-architecture distillation methods. Our findings suggest that attention-based knowledge can be efficiently transferred to recurrent models, enabling rapid utilization of Transformer expertise for building a stronger SSM community.
